      <description>Note An important way to free our mind of clutter is writing down explicitly what we&amp;rsquo;re not going to do, also known as the the to don&amp;rsquo;t list. It can capture things like tasks you&amp;rsquo;ve been putting off for a long time, or simply something that you don&amp;rsquo;t feel will bring you value, but you are doing just to feel a sense of being productive. Crossing stuff off the to don&amp;rsquo;t list can be just as fulfilling as the to do, because it&amp;rsquo;s a feeling of taking control of your life and making choices, as well as having time to &amp;ldquo;stop and smell the roses&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Note Appreciate your smaller goals and smaller victories on the way to the bigger ones, while keeping in mind the bigger goal always of course.

      <description>Note When you find yourself consumed by worry, either by something happening in your life, or while watching a movie, a great mindfulness technique is to focus on the sensations of the body at that moment, to &amp;ldquo;give your brain a break&amp;rdquo; from itself and moving your thoughts to a sensory level. I have found myself doing that in meetings for example when i&amp;rsquo;m feeling anxiety. Haven&amp;rsquo;t tried it with horror movies as well as was advertised, but it could work there as well.</description>

      <description>Note Confidence. It&amp;rsquo;s a finicky thing, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? Do we have it, do we not, how important is it? They say that in order to be successful in life you need confidence, you need to be sure of yourself and perform every action with the knowledge that you can and will succeed.
But wait a minute. That&amp;rsquo;s all great stuff, but we fail to notice one thing - confidence is not something you&amp;rsquo;re born with, well at least most of us aren&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>Note The mind is our most valuable asset. But it also can be our biggest enemy. It&amp;rsquo;s ironic. If we learn to condition it, to calm it, to control it to focus on the positive and the drive to improve ourselves, we can go a long way to making our life better. Letting the bad thoughts float past us, because that&amp;rsquo;s what they are - fleeting. We have lived out so many terrible things in our heads that will never come to pass.</description>

      <description>Note We might not need this thing called confidence. But rather we need to condition our minds, to help them realize two things - life is short, and you don&amp;rsquo;t have that much to lose that you can afford to attribute every lack of action to lack of confidence. It&amp;rsquo;s a vicious circle of sorts - you can&amp;rsquo;t perform actions without confidence, you can&amp;rsquo;t get confidence without performing successful actions. So why don&amp;rsquo;t we just eliminate the middle man?</description>

      <description>Note To create a lasting habit for a productivity (or any habit, for that matter), you can start with an X day challenge to do the habit - that way you have the opportunity to see how the habit fits in to your regular routine and adapt it / change it.

      <guid>http://notes.gbojinov.xyz/timeline/20210217225610-languages-are-tools/</guid>
      <description>Note When speaking to somebody, don&amp;rsquo;t focus on yourself and how you might screw up language-wise or grammar-wise, focus on the person you&amp;rsquo;re speaking to and the goal you want to achieve. A language is a tool, used to get what you want and get stuff done. If your confidence becomes shaky the other person might misinterpret that and think it&amp;rsquo;s because you can&amp;rsquo;t get the job done.

      <description>Note The Eisenhower matrix for organising your day/week/month This is based off the idea of prioritisation of tasks - it has four quadrants:
 Important and urgent tasks - do them right away Important but not urgent tasks - schedule them for later but still so them Not important but urgent - delegate OR automate them somehow Not important and not urgent - annihilate them, time wasters are here  Links to this note  How to USE Productivity Advice (Instead of Just Consuming It)   A couple of ideas:</description>

      <description>Note When starting out with a productivity practice, it can be very useful to follow someone else&amp;rsquo;s system and then adapt it to work for you. Takes off the pressure of coming up with a solution from scratch and frankly, wasting the mental energy to reinvent the wheel and it allows you to build upon something existing.
