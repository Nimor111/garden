            <description>Note An important way to free our mind of clutter is writing down explicitly what we&amp;rsquo;re not going to do, also known as the the to don&amp;rsquo;t list. It can capture things like tasks you&amp;rsquo;ve been putting off for a long time, or simply something that you don&amp;rsquo;t feel will bring you value, but you are doing just to feel a sense of being productive. Crossing stuff off the to don&amp;rsquo;t list can be just as fulfilling as the to do, because it&amp;rsquo;s a feeling of taking control of your life and making choices, as well as having time to &amp;ldquo;stop and smell the roses&amp;rdquo;.</description>

            <description>Note When you find yourself consumed by worry, either by something happening in your life, or while watching a movie, a great mindfulness technique is to focus on the sensations of the body at that moment, to &amp;ldquo;give your brain a break&amp;rdquo; from itself and moving your thoughts to a sensory level. I have found myself doing that in meetings for example when i&amp;rsquo;m feeling anxiety. Haven&amp;rsquo;t tried it with horror movies as well as was advertised, but it could work there as well.</description>

            <description>Note Confidence. It&amp;rsquo;s a finicky thing, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? Do we have it, do we not, how important is it? They say that in order to be successful in life you need confidence, you need to be sure of yourself and perform every action with the knowledge that you can and will succeed.
But wait a minute. That&amp;rsquo;s all great stuff, but we fail to notice one thing - confidence is not something you&amp;rsquo;re born with, well at least most of us aren&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

<p>Confidence. It&rsquo;s a finicky thing, isn&rsquo;t it? Do we have it, do we not, how important is it? They say that in
order to be successful in life you need confidence, you need to be sure of yourself and perform every action
with the knowledge that you can and will succeed.</p>
<p>But wait a minute. That&rsquo;s all great stuff, but we fail to notice one thing - confidence is not something you&rsquo;re
born with, well at least most of us aren&rsquo;t. How do we acquire it? How can we develop this quality that seems so
important for success? Life has a way of showing us the finger and wrecking our confidence a lot. That&rsquo;s one of
its, hm, major qualities. So chances are that our confidence will be screwed even before it has had a chance to
set its roots.</p>

            <description>Note The mind is our most valuable asset. But it also can be our biggest enemy. It&amp;rsquo;s ironic. If we learn to condition it, to calm it, to control it to focus on the positive and the drive to improve ourselves, we can go a long way to making our life better. Letting the bad thoughts float past us, because that&amp;rsquo;s what they are - fleeting. We have lived out so many terrible things in our heads that will never come to pass.</description>

<p>The mind is our most valuable asset. But it also can be our biggest enemy. It&rsquo;s ironic. If we learn to condition
it, to calm it, to control it to focus on the positive and the drive to improve ourselves, we can go a long way
to making our life better. Letting the bad thoughts float past us, because that&rsquo;s what they are - fleeting. We
have lived out so many terrible things in our heads that will never come to pass. And they are not helping in
any way. Only making us feel worse and sometimes, leading to terrible things. What a mind can do when it&rsquo;s
influenced by something like the internet! It&rsquo;s scary to think about. Mindfulness, meditation, constant care is
what the mind requires. You can let it flow, let the ideas come, but when a bad one appears on the horizon,
don&rsquo;t let it take root. Think about how it&rsquo;s helping you right now, the answer will probably be in no way is it
helping you. Then let it pass by focusing on the body, by focusing on something tangible, so that the bad
thought can go its way out of the mind. And therein lies the key to a healthy mind. Well, at least I hope so.</p>

            <description>Note We might not need this thing called confidence. But rather we need to condition our minds, to help them realize two things - life is short, and you don&amp;rsquo;t have that much to lose that you can afford to attribute every lack of action to lack of confidence. It&amp;rsquo;s a vicious circle of sorts - you can&amp;rsquo;t perform actions without confidence, you can&amp;rsquo;t get confidence without performing successful actions. So why don&amp;rsquo;t we just eliminate the middle man?</description>

<p>We might not need this thing called confidence. But rather we need to condition our minds, to help them
realize two things - life is short, and you don&rsquo;t have that much to lose that you can afford to attribute every
lack of action to lack of confidence. It&rsquo;s a vicious circle of sorts - you can&rsquo;t perform actions without
confidence, you can&rsquo;t get confidence without performing successful actions. So why don&rsquo;t we just eliminate the
middle man? Something I heard in Young Sheldon struck me as quite deep. What do I do when i&rsquo;m afraid? He asks
his sister. She says: &ldquo;I guess we should be afraid and do it anyway.&rdquo; And how true that rings! While someone is
thinking how little confidence they have and how they can&rsquo;t achieve anything because their confidence has been
defeated by life, someone else just takes the step. Despite being afraid and not having confidence. The mind can
always convince us that we can&rsquo;t do something. It&rsquo;s just what it does. It&rsquo;s a parasite of sorts. Annoys the hell
out of me. So, in the end, ask yourself not am I confident enough, but rather, what exactly do I have to lose?
Is it worth actually not doing it because of that? I&rsquo;m fairly certain in most cases the answer will be no it&rsquo;s
not. Because you&rsquo;ll regret it. And regret is not something you want to die with. You regret the things you
didn&rsquo;t do more than those you do. What would&rsquo;ve happened if I&rsquo;d taken that opportunity to do something? That I
passed it up because I thought I wasn&rsquo;t confident enough. But looking back, it would&rsquo;ve only helped me. And the
fear of failure and lack of confidence don&rsquo;t matter all that much anymore.</p>

            <description>Note When speaking to somebody, don&amp;rsquo;t focus on yourself and how you might screw up language-wise or grammar-wise, focus on the person you&amp;rsquo;re speaking to and the goal you want to achieve. A language is a tool, used to get what you want and get stuff done. If your confidence becomes shaky the other person might misinterpret that and think it&amp;rsquo;s because you can&amp;rsquo;t get the job done.

            <description>Note When starting out with a productivity practice, it can be very useful to follow someone else&amp;rsquo;s system and then adapt it to work for you. Takes off the pressure of coming up with a solution from scratch and frankly, wasting the mental energy to reinvent the wheel and it allows you to build upon something existing.
