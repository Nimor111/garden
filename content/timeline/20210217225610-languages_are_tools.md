## Note {#note}

When speaking to somebody, don't focus on yourself and how you might screw up language-wise or grammar-wise, focus on the person you're speaking to and the goal you want to achieve. A language is a tool, used to get what you want and get stuff done. If your confidence becomes shaky the other person might misinterpret that and think it's because you can't get the job done.
