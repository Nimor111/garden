## Note {#note}

The Eisenhower matrix for organising your day/week/month
This is based off the idea of prioritisation of tasks - it has four quadrants:

1.  Important and urgent tasks - do them right away
2.  Important but not urgent tasks - schedule them for later but still so them
3.  Not important but urgent - delegate OR automate them somehow
4.  Not important and not urgent - annihilate them, time wasters are here
