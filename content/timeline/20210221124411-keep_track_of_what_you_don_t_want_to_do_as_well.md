## Note {#note}

An important way to free our mind of clutter is writing down explicitly what we're not going to do, also known
as the the to don't list. It can capture things like tasks you've been putting off for a long time, or simply
something that you don't feel will bring you value, but you are doing just to feel a sense of being
productive. Crossing stuff off the to don't list can be just as fulfilling as the to do, because it's a feeling
of taking control of your life and making choices, as well as having time to "stop and smell the roses".
