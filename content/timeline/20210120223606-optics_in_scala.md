## Peering into Scala optics with Monocle {#peering-into-scala-optics-with-monocle}


### Introduction {#introduction}

Salutations. Today i'm going to do an overview of one of my favourite functional programming concepts - optics. Most articles on this topic focus on Haskell so I'm going to try to present the topic using Scala and the [Monocle](https://github.com/optics-dev/monocle) library.

My assumptions for the reader is that they are familiar with basic functional Scala, the concept of type classes and some of the more popular ones.


### Optics - The What and The Why {#optics-the-what-and-the-why}

Let's start with an example.
The examples of this post are taken from this fantastic page about optics: [Link](https://impurepics.com/posts/2020-03-22-optics.html)


#### Initial steps {#initial-steps}

Let's define some types.

```scala
object Types {
  case class Name(value: String) extends AnyVal
  case class Stock(value: Int) extends AnyVal

  case class Bar(fridges: List[Fridge])
  case class Fridge(beers: List[Beer])
  case class Beer(name: Option[Name], stock: Option[Stock])
}
```

And here's what a `Bar` would look like sent over an API in a format like JSON:

```javascript
{
  "fridges": [{
    "beers": [
      {
        "name": "Starobrno",
        "stock": 5
      },
      {
        "stock": 2
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "beers": [
      {
        "name": "Starobrno",
      },
      {
        "name": "Staropramen",
        "stock": 6
      }
    ]
  }]
}
```

Objects in the real world can look quite a bit more nested than this, but it's a good place to start.


#### Let's play around with our data {#let-s-play-around-with-our-data}

So we're imagining we're a bar and we store information about the beers we're selling and how many we have in stock. Of course, we keep them in a fridge, and our bar has multiple fridges. Not every beer has a name or a stock. (Maybe we brew our own type of beer!)

Let's walk through a couple of use cases of what we would like to do with our beers.

-   We receive a shipment of beers for our first fridge and we would like to bump all of our stock by a certain amount. How would we do that?

    Here's a way with regular (functional and immutable) Scala:

    ```scala
      val beer1 = Beer(Some(Name("Starobrno")), Some(Stock(5)))
      val beer2 = Beer(None, Some(Stock(3)))
      val bar = Bar(List(Fridge(List(beer1, beer2))))

      // Woo, a shipment comes!

      val updatedBar = Bar(
      bar.fridges.map(fridge =>
        Fridge(fridge.beers.map(beer =>
          Beer(beer.name, beer.stock.map(s =>
            Stock(s.value + 1)))))))

      println(updatedBar)
      // Bar(List(Fridge(List(Beer(Some(Name(Starobrno)),Some(Stock(6))), Beer(None,Some(Stock(4)))))))
    ```

    This works, but is less than ideal.

-   We would like to figure out how much stock we have in our bar.

    ```scala
      bar.fridges.foldLeft(0)((total, fridge) =>
        total + fridge.beers.foldLeft(0)((fridgeTotal, beer) =>
          fridgeTotal + beer.stock.getOrElse(Stock(0)).value))

      // 8
    ```

    Again, less than ideal.

So, what can we do to make this code more concise and less convoluted?

Enter optics.


#### What do optics do and why should we care about them? {#what-do-optics-do-and-why-should-we-care-about-them}

To be able to easily traverse deeply nested data structures (which is often the case with API responses) with minimal code and without all these nested maps, folds, conditionals, etc. Optics make very good use of the compositional and pure nature of FP.

Optics are an abstraction characterized by several operations, which revolve around getting a particular field, setting it, or modifying it.

There are several types of optics.

`NB` Optics are called so because you "focus" into specific elements of nested data structures with them, like the foci of an optical device.


### Types of optics {#types-of-optics}

I will present three main types of optics: first with a little theory (the type definition and operations it supports), and then with an example with our data using the Monocle library.


#### Lens {#lens}

<!--list-separator-->

-  Theory

    Lenses are used for getting and setting fields of deeply nested product types, when you know the value is there. (it's not optional)

    A lens is defined by the following operations:

    1.  `get` (to get the value of the focused field)
    2.  `set` (to change the value of the focused field)
    3.  `modify` (to get an element and apply a function to it) - this can be expressed through `get` and `set` so it's not required in an implementation

    The `SimpleLens` describes a structure of type `S` that contains a focused field of type `A`

    ```scala
    abstract class SimpleLens[S, A] {
      def get(s: S): A
      def set(s: S, b: A): S
      def modify(s: S)(f: A => A): S = set(s, f(get(s)))
    }
    ```

    The type is actually a bit more complicated

    ```scala
    abstract class Lens[S, T, A, B] {
      def get(s: S): A
      def set(s: S, b: B): T
      def modify(s: S)(f: A => B): T = set(s, f(get(s)))
    }

    // so SimpleLens is
    type SimpleLens[S, A] = Lens[S, S, A, A]
    ```

    -   S - input structure type, our nested data structure
    -   T - output structure type, since setting the field can change the type (changing an int field to a string for example)
    -   A - input field type
    -   B - output field type - again, the input type might change

    The `SimpleLens` is a convenient alias for when the input and output types are the same.

    We create specific lenses for the fields we want to work with, e.g. we "focus" on the field.

    To create a lens for the name field of the `Beer` type (let's ignore the `Option` there for now, we'll get to that later), we need a way to get a field from a case class and a way to set it. The minimal implementation for a `Lens` is to define `get` and `set` since `modify` can be expressed through them.

    ```scala
    case class Name(value: String)
    case class Beer(name: Name)

    // We focus on the field with type Name of the Beer class
    val beerName = new SimpleLens[Beer, Name] {
      def get(s: Beer): Name = s.name
      def set(s: Beer, newName: Name): Beer = s.copy(name = newName)
    }

    beerName.get(Beer(Name("Staropramen"))) // Name(Staropramen)
    beerName.set(Beer(Name("Staropramen")), Name("Starobrno")) // Beer(Name(Staropramen))
    beerName.modify(Beer(Name("Staropramen")))(n => Name(n.value + "!")) // Beer(Name(Staropramen!))
    ```

<!--list-separator-->

-  In Practice

    The Monocle library provides convenient apply methods for creating a Lens by providing a get and set function. It also provides macros such as `GenLens` that avoid a lot of the boilerplate, but I'm not going to touch on them in this post.

    ```scala
    import monocle.Lens

    val barFridges = Lens[Bar, List[Fridge]](_.fridges)(newFridges => bar => bar.copy(fridges = newFridges))

    val fridgeBeers = Lens[Fridge, List[Beer]](_.beers)(newBeers => fridge => fridge.copy(beers = newBeers))

    // We'll get to the options soon
    val beerStock = Lens[Beer, Stock](_.stock)(newStock => beer => beer.copy(stock = newStock))

    val beerName = Lens[Beer, Name](_.name)(newName => beer => beer.copy(name = newName))

    // Some examples
    barFridges.get(bar)
    fridgeBeers.set(fridge, List(beer1, beer2))
    beerStock.modify(beer)(s => Stock(s.value + 5))
    ```


#### Prism {#prism}

<!--list-separator-->

-  Theory

    Prisms are used for getting and setting fields of deeply nested product types when the value might not be there. More generally, a prism captures a certain constructor of a sum type (since Option is simply a sum type with two constructors).

    A nice way to think about prisms is that they define an is-a relationship and lenses define a has-a relationship.

    A prism is defined by:

    1.  `match` (a matcher function that returns an `Either` - Left if the constructor is not matched, Right if it is)
    2.  `construct` (a function to wrap a value into the constructor)

    These operations are used to define some more convenient ones:

    1.  `preview` (to get the value of the focused field, or None if it's not there) - this is analoguous to get, but returns an `Option`
    2.  `review` (to wrap a value in the constructor)

    The `SimplePrism` type describes a structure `S` that contains a focused field of type `A` that might not be there

    ```scala
    abstract class SimplePrism[S, A] {
      // because reserved word
      def matcher(a: A): Either[S, A]
      def construct(a: A): S

      // the double match
      def preview(a: A): Option[A] = this.matcher(a) match {
        case Right(a) => Some(a)
        case Left(_) => None
      }

      def review(a: A): Option[A] = this.construct(a)
    }
    ```

    The type is actually a bit more complicated

    ```scala
    abstract class Prism[S, T, A, B] {
      // we might choose a different type for our Left, some error for example
      def matcher(a: A): Either[T, A]
      // he we wrap whatever the result of our computation is back into the result sum type
      def construct(b: B): T

      def preview(a: A): Option[A] = this.matcher(a) match {
        case Right(a) => Some(a)
        case Left(_) => None
      }

      def review(b: B): T = this.construct(b)
    }

    // so SimplePrism is
    type SimplePrism[S, A] = Prism[S, S, A, A]
    ```

    -   S - input structure type
    -   T - output structure type, since setting the field can change the type (changing an int field to string for example)
    -   A - input field type, a variant of a sum type
    -   B - output field type - again, might change, a variant of a sum type

    The `SimplePrism` is a convenient alias for when the input and output types are the same.

    Let's create a prism for the `Some` constructor of the `Option` type, since we have several optional fields in our data.

    ```scala
    // puns
    val somePrism = new SimplePrism[Option[A], A] {
      def matcher(a: A): Either[Option[A], A] = a match {
        // the value is there
        case Some(y) => Right(y)
        // the value is missing
        case None => Left(None)
      }

      def construct(a: A): Option[A] = Some(a)
    }

    somePrism.preview(Some(5)) // Some(5)
    somePrism.review(5) // Some(5)
    ```

    This isn't the most sensible example in of itself, but when we get to composing optics it'll be very convenient. In fact, it's so convenient that there is another type of optic, `Optional`, which composes a `Lens` and this prism to create lenses for optional fields.

<!--list-separator-->

-  In Practice

    Since we will be using mainly the simple versions of the optics in our explorations (without changing the output types), we can use `Maybe` in our matching function instead of `Either`, which is there to keep the context of our switched `T` type.
    Luckily, Monocle provides an apply method to supply a matching function with `Maybe` as the return type. What's more, it provides a `Prism.partial` constructor, which allows a partial function to be passed, making the code even more concise. Let's rewrite our prism for `Some` using Monocle.

    ```scala
    import monocle.Prism

    val prismOption[A]: Prism[Option[A], A] = Prism.partial[Option[A], A]{case Some(v) => v}(Some(_))
    ```

    Neat, right?

    Preview is called `getOption`, and review is `reverseGet`.

    ```scala
    prismOption.getOption(Some(Name("Starobrno"))) // Some(Name(Starobrno))
    prismOption.reverseGet(Name("Starobrno")) // Some(Name(Starobrno))
    ```

    I promise, it'll make sense in a bit.


#### Traversal {#traversal}

<!--list-separator-->

-  Theory

    Traversals are the meat and bread of traversing(get it?) nested data, because they deal with lists of values. A traversal focuses on 0 or more values of a type, or a field that is a list of values of the same type. So a lens is actually a traversal that focuses on a single value, and a prism is a traversal that focuses on on 0 or 1 value.

    A Traversal is basically a wrapper around types that can be traversed. `traverse` is like `map`, but the function that is applied to each element of the structure is effectful. A `Traversal` allows us to transform values of a field in any way we like.

    A traversal is, not surprisingly, defined by the following function:

    1.  `traverse` (apply an effectful function to each element of a structure)

    This operation is used to define very many others, and implementing them will take longer than a reasonably sized blog post, so i'll just show their usage.

    ```scala
    abstract class SimpleTraversal[S, A] {
      // traverse requires that the effect is an instance of Applicative
      def traverse[F[_]: Applicative](f: A => F[A])(s: S): F[S]
    }
    ```

    As always, the type can be more complicated.

    ```scala
    abstract class Traversal[S, T, A, B] {
      def traverse[F[_]: Applicative](f: A => F[B])(s: S): F[T]
    }

    type SimpleTraversal[S, A] = Traversal[S, S, A, A]
    ```

    The type parameter explanation is the same as for the previous optics.

    To implement a traversal, we can use the `Traverse` type class from cats (not to be confused with the default `Traversable` from Scala, though they sure meant us to confuse the two, since that is what `Traverse` is called in Haskell) and simply take its `traverse` method implementation.

    ```scala
    // List[_] is an instance of ~Traverse~
    val listTraversal[List[A], A] = new SimpleTraversal {
      def traverse[F[_]: Applicative](f: A => F[A])(s: List[A]): F[List[A]] = s.traverse(f) // assuming an extension method traverse is defined
    }
    ```

<!--list-separator-->

-  In Practice

    We'll define traversals for our list of fridges and list of bars. Monocle provides a `Traversal.fromTraverse` constructor that does what we did above. It has a `Traverse` type class constraint.

    ```scala
    import monocle.Traversal

    val fridgeTraversal: Traversal[List[Fridge], Fridge] = Traversal.fromTraverse[List, Fridge]
    val beersTraversal: Traversal[List[Beer], Beer] = Traversal.fromTraverse[List, Beer]
    ```

    We can get all beers, which will make more sense when we compose the optics

    ```scala
    val beer1 = Beer(Some(Name("Starobrno")), Some(Stock(4)))
    val beer2 = Beer(None, Some(Stock(3)))

    val beers = List(beer1, beer2)

    beersTraversal.getAll(beers) // List(beer1, beer2)
    ```

    For a more sensible example, we can fold them to calculate all the stock (using a monoid for Stock). I will cheat a bit here and use a compose, which I will cover in the next (culminative) section.

    ```scala
    import monocle.Optional
    import cats.Monoid

    // Composing a lens for Stock and a prism for Option yields an Optional
    val beerStockOptional = Optional[Beer, Stock](_.stock)(newStock => beer => beer.copy(stock = Some(newStock)))

    implicit val stockMonoid: Monoid[Stock] = new Monoid[Stock] {
      override def empty: Stock = Stock(0)
      override def combine(x: Stock, y: Stock): Stock = Stock(x.value + y.value)
    }

    // uses the Stock monoid
    beersL.composeOptional(beerStockOptional).fold(beers) // Stock(7)

    ```


### Composability {#composability}

Now that we've looked at some of the main types of optics, it's time to see how they can be used with real data (or in our case, the data we defined at the beginning of the post). The power of optics lies in their ability to compose. By composing them we can perform the nested traversal that makes optics so useful.

Skipping over the theory, as that is a post on its own, the main thing to note is that, for the optics we presented, every one of them, composed with a `Traversal`, yields a `Traversal`. This means that a composed optic will most often be a `Traversal` and will begin with a `Traversal` of some kind, either for a specific field (since a `Lens` is a `Traversal`), followed by a list of something. Sound familiar?

I'm going to go straight to the Monocle examples for this.


### Optics in full {#optics-in-full}


#### Optics for a bar {#optics-for-a-bar}

So we want to focus on the `Stock` of the beers in our bar, starting from the top. Let's see how that goes.

First we define the separate optics. Yet again, i'm not using the macros provided by Monocle.

Imports

```scala
import monocle.{Lens, Traversal, Optional}
```

A Lens for the "fridges" field

```scala
val barFridges: Lens[Bar, List[Fridge]] = Lens[Bar, List[Fridge]](_.fridges)(newFridges => bar => bar.copy(fridges = newFridges))
```

Now we need to Traverse the fridges

```scala
val fridgesL: Traversal[List[Fridge], Fridge] = Traversal.fromTraverse[List, Fridge]
```

A Lens for the "beers" field

```scala
val fridgeBeers: Lens[Fridge, List[Beer]] = Lens[Fridge, List[Beer]](_.beers)(newBeers => fridge => fridge.copy(beers = newBeers))
```

Now we need to Traverse the beers

```scala
val beersL: Traversal[List[Beer], Beer] = Traversal.fromTraverse[List, Beer]
```

An optional for the "stock" field, since it's optional

```scala
val beerStock: Optional[Beer, Stock] = Optional[Beer, Stock](_.stock)(newStock => beer => beer.copy(stock = Some(newStock))
```

And now... we compose. The function names should be self explanatory.

```scala
val barStocks: Traversal[Bar, Stock] =
  barFridges.
    composeTraversal(fridgesL).
    composeLens(fridgeBeers).
    composeTraversal(beersL).
    composeOptional(beerStock)
```

And there we have it. Now, to test it out.

```scala
val firstFridgeBeer1 = Beer(Some(Name("Starobrno")), Some(Stock(5)))
val firstFridgeBeer2 = Beer(Some(Name("")), Some(Stock(2)))
val secondFridgeBeer1 = Beer(Some(Name("Starobrno")), None)
val secondFridgeBeer2 = Beer(Some(Name("Staropramen")), Some(Stock(6)))

val fridges = List(
  Fridge(List(firstFridgeBeer1, firstFridgeBeer2)),
  Fridge(List(secondFridgeBeer1, secondFridgeBeer2)))
val bar = Bar(fridges)
```

Get the total stock. We again require the `Stock` monoid implicit in scope.

```scala
println(barStocks.fold(bar)) // Stock(13)
```

Bump all the stock.

```scala
println(barStocks.fold(barStocks.modify(s => Stock(s.value + 1))(bar))) // Stock(16)
```

I think that looks way better than the previous solutions.


#### Operators {#operators}

Finally, since Haskell libraries enjoy using fancy operators so much (not to debate on their usefulness or anything), Monocle provides some of those as well:

```scala
val barStocksOperators: Traversal[Bar, Stock] =
  barFridges ^|->> fridgesL ^|-> fridgeBeers ^|->> beersL ^|-? beerStock
```

I'll leave the decision up to you whether to use them or not.


### Summary and Resources {#summary-and-resources}

I hope this journey through optics has been a useful and informative one for you. When used correctly, they can result in much cleaner and declarative code for accessing fields. Granted, you do need a bit of context, but that's the usual case. And they have fancy names!

Here are some resources if you want to learn more about optics. There are more types of optics that I didn't cover here, but they are usually some modification of the three presented.
