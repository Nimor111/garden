## Note {#note}

Regular note taking doesn't prioritize connections between pieces of knowledge. The Zettelkasten is an attempt
to capitalize on connecting notes rather than connecting them so that more meaningful output can come out of
note taking. According to the Zettelkasten philosophy, a note is only useful in its context, e.g. other notes it relates to.

Simple workflow:

1.  When reading, make literature notes - notes on an article, each key idea into a sentence that later is to
    become a permanent note.
2.  Write an idea on a card / permanent note
3.  Link it to other, already existing, ideas
4.  Sort ideas into topics with topic links

The key is making connections `during` note taking, not when writing and reviewing afterwards.
