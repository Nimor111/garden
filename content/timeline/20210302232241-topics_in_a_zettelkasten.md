Examples of topics:

1.  A note with a topic of clusterization rather than the more general machine learning will come in handy when writing about or doing research on clusterization.
2.  When writing a note about haskell, tag it with - pure functional programming, strong type system, using types
    to prove stuff at compile time, instead of tagging it with just haskell.
