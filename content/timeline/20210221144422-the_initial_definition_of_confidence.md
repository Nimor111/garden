## Note {#note}

Confidence. It's a finicky thing, isn't it? Do we have it, do we not, how important is it? They say that in
order to be successful in life you need confidence, you need to be sure of yourself and perform every action
with the knowledge that you can and will succeed.

But wait a minute. That's all great stuff, but we fail to notice one thing - confidence is not something you're
born with, well at least most of us aren't. How do we acquire it? How can we develop this quality that seems so
important for success? Life has a way of showing us the finger and wrecking our confidence a lot. That's one of
its, hm, major qualities. So chances are that our confidence will be screwed even before it has had a chance to
set its roots.
